Custom Gapps Package 

Core and basic gapps doesn't include google assistant and android auto 

stock gapps cannot be flashed due to /system 500mb of data after unpacking

TWRP /system resize may be risky 

So, built a custom gapps package from NikGapps,after many test builds and working build I would like to share working build here

GApps size -- 226 MB(zip)-- =~ 430 MB (Unpacked) 

No need to wipe Dalvik cache as I set a default flag to wipe it off after gapps installation

gapps include
----------------


google assistant (Now working but you must download google speech services from play store)

android auto (out of the box)

google go gallery (simple gallery is not good enough I suppose)

google go mail (Gmail app is memory hungry I suggest to use latest android webview for better experience)

google go files (Stock files dosn't have search option effectievely often worst in some situation)

Device Health services (Improves efficiency --of-- battery health and performance as per scenario)

Storage Manager

Google Documents UI (replaces Stock files UI and integrates gallery go)

 
Base files and services
-----------------------


GooglePlayStore

GoogleServicesFramework

GoogleContactsSyncAdapter

GoogleCalendarSyncAdapter

GmsCore
